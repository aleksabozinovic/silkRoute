          Additional costs will be determined by each client’s education, work
          experience, nationality, age, and other factors that the client will
          specify on their questionnaire. As stated above, we deeply care about
          each person and their unique story. That’s why every step of the
          process, including pricing, will be tailored to each individual who
          trusts us with their transition.

          You’re probably wondering,
          <span class="red--text">but what about my wife and kids?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="blue--text">
          We have good news! Your wife and kids are more than welcome to come
          along. The spouse of a new resident automatically qualifies for
          residency as a dependent; he/she is free to work without restrictions
          in Latvia. Children under the age of 18 also automatically qualify for
          residency. Time for a family group hug!

      <h1 class="blue--text">10 Fascinating Facts About Latvia</h1>

      <p id="first__p" class="blue--text">
        While most people have heard of Latvia, they are unaware of all the
        things that make the country a true treasure. Situated along the
        beautiful Baltic Sea between Estonia and Lithuania, Latvia boasts
        immaculate coastlines, vast stretches of untouched wilderness, and
        charming cities known for great food, even greater people, and some of
        the best free internet connectivity in the world! Read on to discover
        ten fascinating facts about one of Europe’s hidden gems.
      </p>

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Midsummer Celebrations</h2>
        <p>
          Latvians certainly know how to have a good time. Nothing proves this
          better than the annual festivities that take place during Midsummer.
          On the shortest night of the year, when the sun stays risen for 18
          hours, many Latvians gather at the beach for a night of singing and
          dancing around bonfires, eating a variety of delectable foods, and
          most importantly, staying awake all night. Many also participate in
          the charming tradition of weaving floral crowns using local
          wildflowers and botanicals. Both men and women alike adorn themselves
          with colorful florals gathered from the surrounding forests. Some
          choose to venture deep into the woods in search of the fabled fern
          blossom, a mythical plant rumored to bloom only once a year. Other
          traditions include bathing in the morning dew and harvesting herbs
          with special powers. With so many unique ways to celebrate life and
          love, Midsummer in Latvia is an event you don’t want to miss!

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Pristine Beaches</h2>
        <p>
          One of many things that makes Latvia special is its stretches of
          stunning beaches. The country has made a point to protect its
          coastline by keeping all construction within the confines of cities,
          towns, and villages, meaning that the beaches are free of pollution,
          uncrowded, and perfectly tranquil. In fact, a trip to the beach in
          Latvia often involves crossing through an expanse of towering pine
          trees before emerging to stunning views of the wild Baltic Sea. While
          some shores, especially ones near the capital of Riga, can get busy
          during summer months, most of the beaches in Latvia are remote and
          offer the perfect opportunity to connect with nature.
        </p>

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Green Country</h2>
        <p>
          Topping the list of reasons why Latvia is a special place is the fact
          that 45% of the tiny country is covered in untainted wilderness. This
          number is expected to increase substantially, too, as Latvia takes an
          active role in afforestation–the planting of trees to create forests
          in areas not previously forested. The Latvian people are deeply
          connected to the forest ecosystem. In fact, forest foraging is a
          common activity in Latvia. Many venture into the woods to harvest
          mushrooms, birch sap juice, wild berries, herbs, and tea leaves.
          Granted a large portion of the forests are free to the public, it’s
          completely legal to come and fill your basket. Latvia is truly a
          nature-lover’s paradise!

        <h2 class="red--text">The Venta Waterfall</h2>
        <p>
          Few know that Latvia is home to the widest waterfall in all of Europe.
          During Spring and Autumn, viewers gather on all sides of the Ventas
          Rumba to witness the flying fish that attempt to leap over the 6 feet
          tall rapid. Visitors can enjoy walking along the width of the falls
          and even bathing in the cool waters. A brick bridge built in 1874 runs
          parallel to the waterfall and offers the perfect spot for viewers to
          observe this natural wonder.

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">The Blood of Heroes</h2>
        <p>
          Latvia has one of the oldest flags in history, which may surprise some
          considering Latvia didn’t officially become a state until 1918.
          However, its flag dates back to 1279! According to legend, a leader of
          a Latvian tribe was tragically killed in battle. Fellow tribe members
          wrapped him in a white cloth that became stained with his blood. The
          following day, the tribe won the battle while flying the bloodstained
          sheet as a flag. This cloth became iconic and was used as inspiration
          for Latvia’s flag, or so the legend goes. Whether the tale is true or
          not, one thing is certain–Latvians see the red stripes on their flag
          as symbolic of the blood their people are willing to shed for freedom
          and sovereignty.

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">A Nation of Singers and Dancers</h2>
        <p>
          Latvians are well known for their love of song and dance. Hundreds of
          thousands of people belong to choirs, theater groups, folk dance
          groups, and orchestras, making the country an emblem of celebration.
          Every five years, the highly anticipated Latvian Song and Dance
          Festival takes place, drawing thousands from around the country and
          even bringing home many Latvians living abroad. Festivities run from
          morning to midnight for an entire week! The festival is the ultimate
          celebration of Latvian culture and tradition expressed through song
          and dance, which is why it is included in the UNESCO List of
          Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Wifi Paradise</h2>
        <p>
          Technology junkies will love the capital city of Riga! With over 800
          free wifi connection points, citizens and visitors never have to go a
          moment without internet access. Nearly all hotels and restaurants have
          wifi, and even some of the parks. What’s more is that the internet is
          extremely fast–one of the fastest in the world as a matter of fact!
        </p>

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">A Land of Castles</h2>
        <p>
          There are roughly 140 castles and palaces in Latvia, most of which are
          scattered throughout the countryside. Some have been beautifully
          preserved over the years, while others have been reduced to ruins.
          These grand structures speak of Latvia’s rich history. From the Baltic
          Crusades to the invasion of the Russian Empire, Latvia has been quite
          the fortified country over the years, and the castles left behind tell
          stories of German knights and Russian czars. The Rundale Palace, the
          Medieval castles of Sigulda, the ever-famous castle of Cēsis, and the
          grandiose Cesvaine Palace are among the most well known and frequently
          visited.

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Winter Wonderland</h2>
        <p>
          There’s no better place to enjoy cold weather activities than in
          Latvia. In the Winter months, glittering snow blankets the ground, and
          icicles hang from buildings and trees. Despite the frigid
          temperatures, exciting activities abound! Dog sledding, ice
          go-karting, snowmobiling, and skiing are some of the top choices for
          winter entertainment in Latvia. Fun fact: to stay warm in the harsh
          climate, grab yourself a pair of traditional Latvian mittens. For
          centuries, grandmothers in the countryside have been knitting wool
          mittens in beautiful patterns and vivid colors, and this tradition
          continues today. There’s nothing better to keep you warm! However, if
          the temperatures drop too low, as they sometimes do in the coldest
          months of January and February, join the hundreds who gather at the
          saunas to escape the blustery weather.

      <div class="blog">
        <h2 class="red--text">Art Nouveau</h2>
        <p>
          Like most cities, Riga has its fair share of skyscrapers and fancy
          modern buildings; however, the capital’s enormous collection of Art
          Nouveau architecture makes it unique from other cities. Characterized
          by vivid colors, organic lines, ornate detailing, and diverse use of
          materials, Art Nouveau swept through Europe in the early 19th century,
          but it didn’t arrive in Latvia until the early 1900s. Despite its
          popularity across Europe and the United States, nowhere was it more
          adored than Riga. With over 800 Art Nouveau buildings in the city,
          Riga is home to the largest collection of Art Nouveau architecture in
          the world.

        treasure.

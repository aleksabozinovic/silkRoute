      <h2 class="red--text">Hi, we’re Silk Route.</h2>
      <p>
        We’re an immigration consultancy firm that specializes in helping people
        like you gain residency in Europe by creating businesses that you own
        and operate. Our company is run by a highly qualified team of
        immigration lawyers, all of whom graduated from the finest European
        universities. Our board of advisors have spent their lives working for
        the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs. Many have served in
        high up positions in Latvian embassies, foreign ministries, as well as
        other embassies across Europe. We also have powerful stakeholders from
        India and other parts of the globe who believe in our mission. But don’t
        let that intimidate you. We’re merely saying...you can trust us! We’re
        all here for one reason: helping you start anew in the EU, and we
        believe that doing so doesn’t have to cost a fortune.

          Our brand name and logo were carefully curated to represent our
          purpose and values. Historically speaking, the Silk Route was an
          ancient trade network that connected China with Europe and the Middle
          East. It promoted the exchange of various valuable goods, including
          silks, spices, and precious stones. We drew inspiration from this
          piece of history when we created our company, as we also specialize in
          the transportation of valuable goods; only this time, our valuable
          good is far more important than any costly fabric or expensive
          gemstone–our valuable good is you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we pride ourselves on inclusivity, we chose to include an
          array of colors in our logo. These various hues represent the flags of
          different nations and express our deepest desire to work with people
          from every corner of the globe. Regardless of where you come from,
          Silk Route is committed to providing you with the highest quality of
          service. We are honored to be part of your journey from one life to
          the next.

          Our mission is to simplify the process of immigration by meeting you
          where you are and working with what you have, so that your dream of a
          new life becomes a reality. Treating you like family from start to
          finish, we design companies tailored to your unique
          situation–companies owned and run by you — that establish EU residency
          and allow you to discover the possibilities of a new life.

          It doesn’t take a crystal ball to see where our company is headed. Our
          dream is to become a global leader in immigration affairs concerning
          individuals who want to plant roots in Europe. We are in the business
          of helping people begin new lives in the EU, and we approach this both
          practically and sustainably. Creating and planting businesses is a
          practical approach to establishing EU residency, while giving full
          autonomy of the company to the individual allows them to sustain their
          success after arrival. Silk Route’s intention is to be one of the best
          residency programs in Europe. We trust that our future promises
          stories of new beginnings and lifelong successes.
